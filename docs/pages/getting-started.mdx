# Getting started

This page describes how to get started buidling an application with Fabric
React.

## Setting up your app

Ensure your application is set up with the latest version of
[Fabric CSS](https://pages.github.schibsted.io/finn/fabric-css/).

See the
[Fabric CSS getting started guide](https://pages.github.schibsted.io/finn/fabric-css/pages/getting-started.html)
for more information.

### Usage with Podium

If you are developing with [Podium](https://podium-lib.io/), Fabric's CSS should
only by included by the
[layout server](https://podium-lib.io/docs/layout/getting_started), not the
individual [podlets](https://podium-lib.io/docs/podlet/getting_started). This
prevents accidentally including several versions of Fabric on the same page.

## TypeScript support

The components are written in TypeScript. To take advantage of this, make sure
your project is up to date on the latest `@types/react` definitions.

```shell
# YARN
yarn add @types/react -D

# NPM
npm i @types/react -D
```
