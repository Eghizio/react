# Getting started

This page describes how to get started building an application with Fabric
React.

## Setting up your app

Ensure your application is set up with the latest version of
[Fabric CSS](https://pages.github.schibsted.io/finn/fabric-css/).

See the
[Fabric CSS getting started guide](https://pages.github.schibsted.io/finn/fabric-css/pages/getting-started.html)
for more information.

## Using TypeScript?

The components are written in TS. To take advantage of that make sure your
project is:

-   Up to date on the latest `@types/react` definitions.
