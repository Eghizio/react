# Checkbox

Checkboxes allow users to select multiple items from a list of individual items,
or to mark one individual item as selected.

When grouping multiple checkboxes together, see [CheckboxGroup](/CheckboxGroup).

<PackageInfo packageData={packageData} componentNames={['Checkbox']} />

## Example

```jsx example
<Checkbox>Toggle me</Checkbox>
```

## Migrating from Troika

-   You should no longer include or import any Troika checkbox CSS.
-   `error` has been deprecated. Use `invalid` instead.
-   `label` has been deprecated. The label should be provided as a child of
    Checkbox instead.

## Value

Checkboxes are not selected by default. The `defaultChecked` prop can be used to
set the default state (uncontrolled). Alternatively, the `checked` prop can be
used to make the checked state controlled. See React's documentation on
[uncontrolled components](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html)
for more info.

```jsx example
function Example() {
    let [checked, setChecked] = React.useState(true);

    return (
        <div className="flex space-x-48">
            <Checkbox defaultChecked>Subscribe (uncontrolled)</Checkbox>

            <Checkbox
                checked={checked}
                onChange={(event) => setChecked(event.target.checked)}
            >
                Subscribe (controlled)
            </Checkbox>
        </div>
    );
}
```

## Labeling

A visual label must be provided for the `Checkbox` by passing children to the
component.

## Help text

Checkboxes can provide additional context with `helpText` if the label isn't
enough.

```jsx example
<Checkbox helpText="We won't hold it against you">Toggle me</Checkbox>
```

## Validation

Checkboxes can communicate to the user whether the current value is invalid.
Implement your own validation logic in your app and set the `invalid` prop to
display it as invalid.

**Note that currently you must provide a `helpText` together with `invalid` for
the checkbox to appear invalid.**

```jsx example
<Checkbox invalid helpText="Must be checked">
    Toggle me
</Checkbox>
```

## Visual options

### Disabled

Keep in mind that using disabled in its current form is an anti-pattern. There will ALWAYS be users who don't understand why an element is disabled, or users who can't even see that it is disabled because of poor lighting conditions or other reasons. Please consider more informative alternatives before choosing to use disabled on an element.

```jsx example
<Checkbox disabled>Toggle me</Checkbox>
```

## Props

```props packages/checkbox/src/Checkbox.tsx

```
